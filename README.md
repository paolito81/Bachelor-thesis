# Bachelor-thesis
A repository containing data analysis for a bachelor thesis in physics.
Works in Visual Studio 2022. 

The thesis will focus on the efficiency characterization of the detector used for the study of the
14 N(p,γ)15 O reaction at the LUNA-400 kV accelerator, located at the Gran Sasso National Laboratories
(LNGS). This reaction is the slowest in the CNO cycle and has a significant impact on the production of
solar CNO neutrinos. The experiment involves sending an intense proton beam onto solid TiN targets.
The gamma radiation emitted from the reaction is detected using a scintillator composed of 6 BGO
crystals covering almost the entire solid angle around the target, inserted in a lead shielding to
suppress environmental background radiation. An accurate characterization of the detector and its
implementation in Geant4 simulations is crucial for the success of the experiment. The detection
efficiency measurement is performed using radioactive sources and a resonance at 278 keV of the
14 N(p,γ) 15 O reaction. The data related to the detection efficiency is used to verify
the accuracy with which these are reproduced by Geant4 simulations.
